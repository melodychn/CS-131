<h1>Homework 6. Evaluate a language for a garage-sale buyer app</h1>

<p><small>[<a href='../index.html'>131 home</a> &gt; <a href='../homework.html'>Homework</a>]</small></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>You’re in a team working on GarageGarner, an application intended
  for people who buy things
  from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_sale'>garage
  sales</a>. The old version is web-based, and most of the computation
  is done in a central server with only the user interface running in
  users' cell phones. Your boss wants a new version that is less
  klunky, and is willing for you to develop a native app to do
  that.</p>

<p>One of the features your boss wants to have is to let the user walk
  into a garage sale, take a panoroma of the items and price tags on
  display, and quickly report to you on what the best deals are.  Your
  current version does something like this by shipping images to the central
  server and having it do all the work, but this is too slow and chews
  up too much network bandwidth. Your boss wants most of the algorithm
  to run in the phone, to make the application faster. Much of the
  algorithm's difficulty revolves around the fact that it uses
  machine-learning based models to process the images, and these can
  take some CPU time to evaluate. However, newer high-end phones such
  as
  the <a href='https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/18/apples-custom-neural-engine-in-iphone-xs-about-letting-nothing-get-in-your-way'>iPhone
  XS</a> and
  the <a href='https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/introducing-next-generation-on-device.html'>Pixel
  4</a> have <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator'>AI
  accelerators</a> for algorithms such as yours, and your boss wants
  your native app to use these accelerators if available.</p>

<p>Your team is investigating alternative technologies to implement
  the new version of the application. You've selected
  <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/lite'>TensorFlow Lite</a> for
  running your model on cell phones, but you need to choose a
  technology for writing and running your app's user interface.
  You've been given the job of looking into
  the <a href='https://flutter.dev/'>Flutter</a> user interface
  toolkit as one of the technology alternatives. Flutter apps are
  written in <a href='https://dart.dev/'>Dart</a>, a language that can
  be compiled to the ARM machine code used in most mobile devices.
  Your boss suggests that the application
  use <a href='https://github.com/shaqian/flutter_tflite'>tflite</a>,
  a Flutter plugin for the TensorFlow Lite API.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this assignment,
  assume <a href='https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-2-7-a3710ec54e97'>Dart
  2.7</a> and <a href='https://medium.com/flutter/announcing-flutter-1-12-what-a-year-22c256ba525d'>Flutter 1.12</a> (2019-12-11), along with tflite v1.0.5 (2020-02-26).</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>We are not expecting working prototypes for the proposed application.</p>

<p>Do some research on Dart and its support software as a
potential platform. Your research should include an examination of the
language and system documentation to help determine whether it would
be effective. We want to know whether Dart supports the proposed
application well.
</p>

<p>Evaluate the features of Dart version 2.7 for the proposed app.
  Compare and contrast them to the features of
  Ocaml, Java, and Python that you used to do earlier
  assignments. What strengths and weaknesses do you see for Dart,
  compared to these other programming languages?  What are the biggest
  problems you anticipate when using Dart for this application?</p>

<p>Write an executive summary that compares and contrasts Dart
  to the other languages, and gives Dart's strengths and weaknesses,
  along with problems for this application.
The
summary should be in 10-point font or larger and should be at most
three pages. You can put references and appendixes in later pages, if
you can’t get under the page limit: the appendixes should contain
any source code or diagrams. Your summary should focus on the
technology’s effects on ease of use, flexibility, generality,
performance, reliability; thie idea is to explore the most-important
language-relevant technical challenges in doing the proposed app. The
summary should
be suitable for software executives, that is, for readers who have
some expertise in software, particularly in managing software
developers, but who are not experts in Dart.
Please keep the <a href='../comm.html'>resources for written
reports and oral presentations</a> in mind, particularly its rubrics
and its advice for citations to sources that you consulted.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a file <samp>hw6.pdf</samp> containing your summary.</p>
